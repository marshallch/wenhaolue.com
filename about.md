## Hi, I’m Wen-Hao Lue.

I’m a programmer, musician, and I dabble in design. I’m currently a Software
Engineering student at the [University of Waterloo], graduating in 2014.

In my spare time, I work on [various projects] and contribute to [open source].
I'm one of the main contributors of [PonyDebugger].

Most recently, I interned at [Twitter], writing Monads in Scala. I previously
worked at [Square] as an iOS Engineer, and [Xtreme Labs].

## Shall we talk?

The best way to contact me is through [email]. You can also ping me [@wlue] on
Twitter.
